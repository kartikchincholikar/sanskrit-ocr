The complementary work of<br>artist Grahame Sydney, fiction writer Owen Marshall and poet<br>Brian Turner was first brought together in the hugely successful<br>Timeless Land in 1995. Its pages showed their shared, deep<br>connection to Central Otago, to its vast skies, its wide plains<br>punctuated by jagged ranges, its unique colours and its dwarfing<br>effect on the people who pass through it. Twenty-five years<br>later, this lavish new volume from these three long-time friends<br>showcases a rich selection of their subsequent work, including<br>recently written, previously unpublished pieces. Through their<br>own marks about the land and its people, be it in ink or paint,<br>they offer a love song to the South Island, in particular<br>Central Otago.

The Explainable<br>Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) task aims at detecting sexism<br>in English text in an accurate and explainable way, thanks to a<br>fine-grained annotation that follows a three-level schema:<br>sexist or not (Task A), category of sexism (Task B) and vector<br>of sexism (Task C) exhibited. We use a multi-task learning<br>approach in which models share representations from all three<br>tasks, allowing for knowledge to be shared across them. Notably,<br>with our approach a single model can solve all three tasks. In<br>addition, motivated by the subjective nature of the task, we<br>incorporate inter-annotator agreement information in our multi-<br>task architecture. Although disaggregated annotations are not<br>available, we artificially estimate them using a 5-classifier<br>ensemble, and show that ensemble agreement can be a good<br>approximation of crowd agreement.
